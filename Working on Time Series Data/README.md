# Understanding Time-Series Data
## Using Neural Networks to work with Time-Series data

### Different Stages that I broke down working with such a different kind of data.
This was my first type, understanding and working in depth with the time series data.
1. Creating a *Synthetic* dataset, Preprocess it for the model and extract out **features** and **targets** from it.
