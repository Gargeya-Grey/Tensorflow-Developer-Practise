# Understanding Time-Series Data
## Using Neural Networks to work with Time-Series data

### Different Stages that I broke down working with such a different kind of data.
This was my first type, understanding and working in depth with the time series data.
1. Creating a *Synthetic* dataset, Preprocess it for the model and extract out **features** and **targets** from it.

2. Using a Single Neuron Neural Network to see how the data and targets react with the model to get weights. How good of a prediction is  possible with a single neuron in terms of Time-Series Data.

1. Here we have a 3-layered Full connected DNN for Synthetic Time-Series Data that we generated earlier. First 2 layers are 10 neurons each and output layer containes 1 neuron. The processing of dataset into Neural network as Input involved sliding window concept. [Notebook]()
